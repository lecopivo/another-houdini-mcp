# Node Study Template

Use this for each `memory/nodes/<context>/<node>.md` note.

## Workflow Reference

Use `memory/houdini_ai_academy.md` section `Workflow (Per Node)` as the canonical end-to-end process.

## Session Status

- Status: planned | in progress | studied
- Docs read: yes/no
- Example set reviewed: yes/no
- Example OTL internals inspected: yes/no
- Node comments read: yes/no
- Sticky notes read: yes/no
- QA pass complete: yes/no

## Source-of-Truth Split

Record both sides explicitly:

- Intent (docs/comments/stickies): what the example says should happen.
- Observed (live scene/params/geometry): what actually happens in this Houdini build.
- Mismatches: list and explain any contradictions.

## Minimum Repro Setup

- Node graph:
- Key parameter names and values:
- Output verification method:
