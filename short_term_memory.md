## Short-Term Memory

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy with new deep node study: `matchtopology`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/matchtopology.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/matchtopology/MatchTopologySphere.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Baseline reordered meshes had large point-number mismatch against reference (RMS `~1.42419`) before remap.
  - Official example setup produced perfect remap in tested branches (`matchtopology_*` RMS `0.0`).
  - Live ambiguity case showed warning (`Connected components had ambiguous matches...`) and non-zero RMS (`~1.414213`) despite successful cook.
  - Adding tracking/reference hints (`trackpts="44 2 71"`, `refpts="0 1 2"`) resolved ambiguity and restored RMS `0.0`.
  - Topology mismatch failure (different reference sphere frequency) raised hard errors for point/primitive count mismatch.
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/matchtopology.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (186 studied, 78.8%, 179 example sets reviewed)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 189 studied; SOP 186)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with MatchTopology ambiguity-resolution pattern (section 112)

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy with new deep node study: `maskbyfeature`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/maskbyfeature.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/maskbyfeature/MaskByFeatureBasic.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Baseline combined output (`Cd`) on example had mean `0.1855` over `2986` points.
  - Enabling directional output added `dir_mask` (mean `0.2562`) without topology change.
  - Direction interaction: reducing `maxangle 90 -> 20` strongly reduced directional contribution (`dir_mask` mean `0.2562 -> 0.0479`).
  - Flipping vector direction (`Y 1 -> -1`) collapsed combined mask in this setup (`Cd` mean `0.1855 -> 0.0000`) while directional remained non-zero.
  - Shadow interaction: `castshadows=0` made combined match directional mean (`0.2561`); `castshadows=1,selfshadows=1` reduced combined mean to `0.1635`.
  - AO interaction (`enableao=1,aosamples=8`) emitted `ao_mask` (mean `0.7085`) and reduced combined mean further to `0.1408`.
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/maskbyfeature.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (185 studied, 78.4%, 178 example sets reviewed)

  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with MaskByFeature multi-channel mask pattern (section 111)

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy with new deep node study: `magnet`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/magnet.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/magnet/MagnetBubbles.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/magnet/MagnetDistortion.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Position mode (`tx=1.0`) with overlapping metaball affected only influenced subset (`moved 96/312`, `max_disp=2.0`).
  - Color-only mode (`position=0`, `color=1`, `sy=-1`) changed `Cd` without moving points; unclamped range dipped below zero (`-0.002`).
  - `clampcolor=1` restored `Cd` range to `[0,1]`.
  - Normal-only mode (`nml=1`, `ty=-69`) changed normals (mean delta `~0.5976`) with zero point displacement.
  - Velocity-only mode (`velocity=1`, `tz=1.5`) changed average `v` from `(0,1,0)` to approximately `(0,0.8536,0.2371)`.
  - Metaball `metaweight` scaled deformation amplitude near-linearly in tested setup (`0.5/2.0/4.0 -> max_disp 0.5/2.0/4.0`).
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/magnet.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (184 studied, 78.0%, 177 example sets reviewed)

- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/lsystem.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/lsystem/LSystemMaster.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/lsystem/LsystemBuilding.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Generation scaling in skeleton mode: `gen 3 -> 5` changed output `13 pts / 3 prims -> 40 pts / 9 prims`.
  - Representation switch (`type`): at same rules/generations, skeleton `40/9/48` vs tube `522/18/522` (pts/prims/verts).
  - `pointwidth=1` in skeleton mode emitted key point attrs (`width`, `arc`, `gen`, `up`, `segs`, `div`, `lage`).
  - Fractional generation interaction: `gen=3.5` with `contLength=1` reduced bbox extent versus `contLength=0` while topology stayed constant.
  - Leaf insertion contract validated: adding `J` command (`B=&FFF[fJ]A`) with leaf input wired increased output from `40/9` to `52/21`.
  - Randomization contract validated: changing `randseed` with non-zero `randscale` changed shape extents while keeping topology fixed.
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/lsystem.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (183 studied, 77.5%, 176 example sets reviewed)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 186 studied; SOP 183)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with LSystem rule-and-representation pattern (section 109)

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy with new deep node study: `linearsolver`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/linearsolver.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/linearsolver/CurveInflation.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Baseline solve emitted point attr `z` with range `0.0 .. 0.562163` (mean `0.172899`) on `8184` points.
  - Direct vs iterative solver produced matching sampled output stats in this tested setup.
  - Clearing `pinnedgroup` changed solve field materially (`z max 0.562163 -> 0.730753`, mean `0.172899 -> 0.287632`).
  - Renaming `vectordstattr` (`z -> z_alt`) moved output attribute contract as expected.
  - `mode=Decompose` removed solved destination attr `z` in this network (mode-contract validation).
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/linearsolver.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (182 studied, 77.1%, 175 example sets reviewed)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 185 studied; SOP 182)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with LinearSolver attribute-contract pattern (section 108)
- Cleanup done:
  - deleted `/obj/academy_CurveInflation`

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy with new deep node study: `line`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/line.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/line/LineDirection.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Primitive contract sweep confirmed `type` mapping: polygon, NURBS, Bezier, and point-only (`0 prims`).
  - Polygon density scaling verified (`points=2 -> 10` produced `2 -> 10` vertices on single primitive).
  - Bezier interaction test showed order-sensitive output (`type=2`, `order 2 -> 6` changed output points `10 -> 11`).
  - Centering expression from example validated: `originx=-ch("dist")/2` kept X-axis line centered as `dist` changed (`4.0 -> 7.5`).
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/line.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (181 studied, 76.7%, 174 example sets reviewed)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 184 studied; SOP 181)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with Line centering-expression pattern (section 107)
- Cleanup done:
  - deleted `/obj/academy_LineDirection`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_line_live`

- 2026-02-15: Reworked FLIP-family SOP notes to richer academy format after quality feedback.
- Rewritten/expanded notes:
  - `memory/nodes/sop/flipcontainer.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/flipboundary.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/flipcollide.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/flipsolver.md`
- Coverage method:
  - No local official example folders were available for these four nodes via `list_example_nodes`.
  - Used node docs + synthetic live validation network: `/obj/academy_flip_detailed`.
- Measured outcomes captured in notes:
  - `flipcontainer`: `particlesep` and `gridscale` produced strong particle-count/detail-attribute changes.
  - `flipboundary`: source/sink + boundary method materially changed FLIP particle counts.
  - `flipcollide`: collision mode changed collision stream primitive contract (`VDB`-style vs extra packed surface payloads).
  - `flipsolver`: boundary mode + substep sweeps changed frame-12 particle totals in reproducible ways.
- Cleanup done:
  - deleted `/obj/academy_flip_detailed` after validation.
- Progress counters unchanged (note-quality rewrite pass, not new node additions).

- 2026-02-15: Continued continuous one-node-at-a-time studies with another 3-node batch.
- Completed nodes:
  - `laplacian`
  - `latticefromvolume`
  - `layer`
- Notes added:
  - `memory/nodes/sop/laplacian.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/latticefromvolume.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/layer.md`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Laplacian: explicit/forward branch became unstable at larger diffusion steps; implicit/backward branch remained numerically stable in tested range.
  - LatticeFromVolume: output type sweep quantified contract differences (points/polyline/tet/hex), and expand padding strongly changed lattice coverage/count.
  - Layer: validated layer metadata contract (`layercount`, `currentlayer`) across MultiTexture/MultiUV; captured local node-doc gap for legacy `layer` SOP.
- Progress updates:
  - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md`: 180 studied, 76.3%, 173 example sets reviewed.
  - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`: overall 183 studied (SOP 180 + DOP 3).
  - `memory/sop_context.md`: added sections 103-105.

  - deleted `/obj/academy_MultiUV`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_MultiTexture`

- 2026-02-15: Continued continuous one-node-at-a-time run; completed next 3 deep node studies.
- Completed nodes:
  - `kinefx--rigdoctor`
  - `kinefx--rigmatchpose`
  - `kinefx--rigmirrorpose`
- Notes added:
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--rigdoctor.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--rigmatchpose.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--rigmirrorpose.md`
- Important nuance for this trio: no official `list_example_nodes` example assets were available for these nodes in current corpus, so studies used thorough live synthetic validation networks.
- Key measured outcomes:
  - RigDoctor: repaired bad names (`arm joint` -> `arm_joint`, empty -> `point_0`), preserved optional raw names when sanitization/init disabled, and validated hierarchy helper attrs.
  - RigMatchPose: verified output-mode contract differences (`Pass Through` vs `Matched Pose`) and global match delta storage via detail `scene_transform`.
  - RigMirrorPose: validated operation modes and mirror mapping behavior; observed token-matching fragility (`value=-1`) versus robust position+name matching.
- Progress updates:
  - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md`: 177 studied, 75.0%.
  - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`: overall 180 studied (SOP 177 + DOP 3).

  - deleted `/obj/academy_rigmatchpose_live`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_rigmirrorpose_live`

- 2026-02-15: Continued one-node-at-a-time deep studies without stopping after a single node.
- Completed nodes in this continuation pass:
  - `kinefx--motionclipsequence`
  - `kinefx--motionclipupdate`
  - `kinefx--rigattribvop`
- Notes added:
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipsequence.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipupdate.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--rigattribvop.md`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Sequence: blend method/region changed sample count and `clipinfo.range` (`method 0/1/2 => 84/83/85 samples`; overlap region growth reduced output range/samples).
  - Update: shoulder-joint Y edits from extracted points propagated into updated clip under `overlapmode=Override`; `Keep Existing` preserved baseline.
  - RigAttribVOP: control edits moved IK chain points as expected; `compute` toggle changed output transform-attribute contract (`localtransform` presence).
- Progress updates:
  - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md`: 174 studied, 73.7%, 169 example sets reviewed.
  - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`: overall 177 studied (SOP 174 + DOP 3).
  - `memory/sop_context.md`: added sections 97-99.
- Cleanup done:
  - deleted `/obj/academy_SimpleMotionClipSequence`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_SimpleMotionClipUpdate`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_IkSolverVop`

- 2026-02-15: Continued one-node-at-a-time study as requested; completed deep study for `kinefx--motionclipretime`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipretime.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipretime/SimpleMotionClipRetime.txt`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Example default (`Range Shift`, speed 0.7): output reduced to `22` samples with range `0..1.1905`, rate `~16.8`.
  - `speed` sweep in Range Shift mode changed rate/duration while keeping sample count stable (`22`).
  - Resample-mode sweeps in this asset showed stable counts/ranges (noted as example-data/default-expression nuance).
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipretime.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (171 studied, 72.5%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 174)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with MotionClipRetime timing-contract pattern (section 96)
- Cleanup done: deleted `/obj/academy_SimpleMotionClipRetime`.

- 2026-02-15: Completed second half of requested 10-node SOP batch (continuous run).
- Completed nodes:
  - `kinefx--motionclipcycle`
  - `kinefx--motionclipevaluate`
  - `kinefx--motionclipextract`
  - `kinefx--motionclipposedelete`
  - `kinefx--motionclipposeinsert`
- Notes added:

  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipevaluate.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipextract.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipposedelete.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipposeinsert.md`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - `motionclipcycle`: `cyclesafter` scaled output duration/prim count (`0.0 -> 56 prims`, `1.5 -> 132`, `3.0 -> 209`).
  - `motionclipextract`: frame range and step strongly changed extracted sample counts; `@name=` group syntax required for reliable joint filtering.
  - `motionclipposedelete`: frame-range invert uses mode-specific `negate2` (`delete10-20 -> 45 prims`, invert keep-only -> 12).
  - `motionclipposeinsert`: inserting into missing frame increased sample count; `overlapmode=Error` correctly triggered cook error on frame conflict.
  - `motionclipevaluate`: official example behaved as effectively static across tested frames (important dataset caveat).
- Progress updates:
  - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md`: 170 studied, 72.0%, 165 example sets reviewed.
  - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`: overall 173 studied (SOP 170 + DOP 3).
  - `memory/sop_context.md`: added sections 94-95.

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy (user requested next 10 nodes, continuous run) and completed first 5 nodes of that batch.
- Completed nodes:
  - `kinefx--characterblendshapes`
  - `kinefx--configurejointlimits`
  - `kinefx--dynamicwarp`
  - `kinefx--motionclip`
  - `kinefx--motionclipblend`
- Notes added:
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--characterblendshapes.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--configurejointlimits.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--dynamicwarp.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclip.md`
  - `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--motionclipblend.md`
- Key batch findings:
  - Character blendshape channels require strict naming contract between `blendshape_channel` metadata and animated channel attrs.
  - Dynamic warp mode/output-length changes are best validated via `clipinfo.range`.
  - MotionClipBlend envelope/effect parameters changed evaluated pose substantially while clip topology stayed stable.
  - ConfigureJointLimits example can contain valid config keys with weak/degenerate numeric limits depending on motion source quality.
- Progress updates:
  - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md`: 165 studied, 69.9%, 160 example sets reviewed.
  - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`: overall 168 studied (SOP 165 + DOP 3).
  - `memory/sop_context.md`: added sections 91-93.
- Cleanup done:
  - deleted `/obj/academy_SimpleCharacterBlendShapes`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_InbetweenShapes`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_ConfigureLimitsFromMotionClip`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_DynamicWarpRemoveStalls`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_SimpleMotionClip`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_SimpleMotionClipBlend`
  - deleted `/obj/academy_characterblendshapes_live`

  - `kinefx--motionclipevaluate`
  - `kinefx--motionclipextract`
  - `kinefx--motionclipposedelete`
  - `kinefx--motionclipposeinsert`

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy and completed deep study for `kinefx--attachjointgeo`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/kinefx--attachjointgeo.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/kinefx--attachjointgeo/capturegeoexample.txt`
- Networks inspected:
  - `/obj/academy_capturegeoexample/capture_geometry_example`
  - Live repro: `/obj/academy_attachjointgeo_live`
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Official example: `add_capture_geometry` had `45` prims with `4` `jointgeo` capture-shape assignments; mirrored transfer produced `47` prims.
  - Live repro: single assignment increased prim count `41 -> 42`; `role=0` set `jointgeo.role='control'`, `role=1` set `jointgeo.role='capture'`.
  - `shape_worldtrans1=1` preserved explicit `jointgeo.offset`; `shape_worldtrans1=0` removed explicit world offset.
  - Important naming nuance: `mergepacked` output primitive name differed from upstream shape name; `shapename#` must match post-pack names.
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--attachjointgeo.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (160 studied, 66.5%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 160)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with AttachJointGeo metadata-contract pattern (section 90)
- Cleanup done: deleted `/obj/academy_capturegeoexample` and `/obj/academy_attachjointgeo_live`.

- 2026-02-15: Continued SOP academy and completed deep study for `kinefx--agentposefromrig`.
- Docs/examples:
  - `nodes/sop/kinefx--agentposefromrig.txt`
  - `examples/nodes/sop/kinefx--agentposefromrig/TransferPoseToAgent.txt`
- Key issue discovered and fixed during study:
  - Loaded example had stale internal object paths (`/obj/TransferPoseToAgent1/...`) after instantiation under `/obj/academy_TransferPoseToAgent`.
  - Repointed `agent1.objsubnet` and `agent1.locomotionnode` to the new object path to restore cooking.
- Key measured outcomes:
  - Root mode contracts differ materially (primitive transform motion vs root-joint application vs ignore).
  - `group`/`joints` act as strict transfer gates.
  - Geometry contract remains stable (`5` points / `5` Agent prims) while pose data changes.
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/kinefx--agentposefromrig.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (159 studied, 66.1%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 159)

- Updated files:
  - `memory/node_study_template.md` (reworked to richer `heightfield_erode-2.0` style with required sections and quality rules)
  - `memory/houdini_ai_academy.md` (workflow + checklist now explicitly require richer note structure and measured outcomes)
  - `AGENTS.md` (tutorial expectations now reference the richer node-note format)

- 2026-02-15: Resumed Houdini AI Academy studies after user request.
- Node studied: `heightfield_erode-2.0`
- Docs reviewed: `nodes/sop/heightfield_erode-2.0.txt` (19746 bytes)
- Examples loaded/inspected:
  - `upscaling`: Multi-resolution erosion upscaling workflow (low-res -> 2x resample -> mid-res -> 2x resample -> high-res)
  - `volcano`: Custom solver-based erosion with lava/water interaction
- Sticky notes captured: Upscaling strategy, custom fluid interaction patterns, negative flow amounts for mass buildup
- Live validation network: `/obj/academy_heightfield_erode_live` (heightfield -> noise -> erode::2.0 -> OUT)
- Parameter testing: `hydro_erosionrate`, `hydro_bankangle`, `rain_amount` confirmed volume topology stability with voxel-level changes
- Multi-frame probe: Verified 6-layer output (`height`, `debris`, `sediment`, `water`, `bedrock`, `mask`) at frames 1, 10, 20
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/heightfield_erode-2.0.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (153 studied, 63.6%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 153)
- Next checkpoint: Continue with next unstudied nodes (hole, isooffset, join, kinefx nodes, etc.)

- 2026-02-15: Continued academy run and completed deep study for `hole`.
- Docs reviewed: `nodes/sop/hole.txt` + example note `examples/nodes/sop/hole/HoleBasic.txt`.
- Example inspected: `/obj/academy_HoleBasic` (all four branches: make_hole, distance_tolerance, angle_tolerance, remove_hole).
- Key measured outcomes:
  - make-hole baseline: `2 prims / 14 verts` -> `1 prim / 16 verts` after bridge.
  - distance gating: `dist=0.05` no bridge (`2/14`), `dist=0.3` bridge (`1/16`).
  - angle gating: increasing `angle` to `80` enabled bridge on rotated interior (`1/16`).
  - snap interaction: `snap=0` kept off-plane depth (`z span ~0.437`), `snap=1` flattened to plane (`z span 0.0`).
  - un-bridge mode: `break=1` restores filled result (`2/14`), `break=0` keeps bridged hole (`1/16`).
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/hole.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (154 studied, 64.0%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 154)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with Hole tolerance-gating pattern (section 84)
- Cleanup done: deleted `/obj/academy_HoleBasic` and `/obj/academy_hole_live` after study.

- 2026-02-15: Continued academy run and completed deep study for `isooffset`.
- Docs reviewed: `nodes/sop/isooffset.txt` + example notes `examples/nodes/sop/isooffset/Brickify.txt`, `examples/nodes/sop/isooffset/SquabVolume.txt`.
- Examples inspected:
  - `/obj/academy_Brickify` (brickify via tetra/cube isooffset workflow)
  - `/obj/academy_SquabVolume` (volume visualization workflow)
- Key measured outcomes:
  - output switch behavior: `iso surface` vs `fog`/`SDF` volumes vs `tetra mesh` modes produced distinct primitive classes.
  - tetra interaction: at `samplediv=30`, `tetratype=1` generated `10144` tetrahedra; coarse sampling can produce empty tetra outputs.
  - mode interaction: `mode=Minimum` with `offset=0` produced empty result, `offset=0.05` produced valid shell (`1478 pts / 1536 prims`).
  - SDF resolution scaling: `samplediv=20 -> (20,9,20)`, `samplediv=60 -> (60,23,60)`.
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/isooffset.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (155 studied, 64.4%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 155)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with IsoOffset output-contract pattern (section 85)
- Cleanup done: deleted `/obj/academy_Brickify`, `/obj/academy_SquabVolume`, and `/obj/academy_isooffset_live` after study.

- 2026-02-15: Continued academy run and completed deep study for `join`.
- Docs reviewed: `nodes/sop/join.txt` + example note `examples/nodes/sop/join/BasicJoin.txt`.
- Example inspected: `/obj/academy_BasicJoin` (both branches: `Join_U_NoWrap_Attribute`, `Join_U_Wrap_Blend`).
- Key measured outcomes:
  - no-wrap branch: `copy1 (3 prims / 300 pts)` -> `join_U (1 prim / 340 pts)` with inherited `Cd` in attribute branch.
  - wrap branch: `copy1 (3 prims / 300 pts)` -> `join_U (1 prim / 270 pts)` with `loop=1`.
  - live sweeps: `prim=1` increased output to 4 prims (kept originals + joined result); `blend`/`tolerance` materially changed join density.
  - input class nuance: polygon inputs still joined in this build and converted to `Mesh` output (contrasts with example sticky warning).
- Memory updates:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/join.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (156 studied, 64.8%)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall 156)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` with Join topology-control pattern (section 86)
- Cleanup done: deleted `/obj/academy_BasicJoin` and `/obj/academy_join_live` after study.

- 2026-02-13: Study plan tightened to prevent lazy batch summaries.
- Updated `memory/houdini_ai_academy.md` with:
  - mandatory deep per-node live parameter play,
  - explicit anti-sloppy rule (no generic batch-note completion),
  - one-node end-to-end completion protocol before moving on.

- 2026-02-13: Reworked study quality standard to deep per-node exploration (no batch-generic summaries).
- Fully re-studied `delete` with careful live play across both official examples (`DeleteDemo`, `DeleteFan`).
- Performed multiple before/after probes on real parameter interactions:

- Updated `memory/nodes/sop/delete.md` to detailed reusable guidance with concrete parameter/geometry deltas and failure modes.

- 2026-02-13: Continued strict deep-play pass and completed another 10 nodes.

- Deep-studied nodes:
  - `curveclay`, `delete`, `deltamush`, `dissolve`, `distancealonggeometry`, `distancefromgeometry`, `divide`, `dopimportrecords`, `duplicate`, `extrude`
- Deep-play highlights:
  - `dissolve`: toggling invert selection collapsed output from `8 pts / 5 prims` to `2 pts / 1 prim` in example branch.
  - `distancealonggeometry` / `distancefromgeometry`: disabling mask output removes `mask` attr while preserving `dist`.
  - `dopimportrecords`: `field` filter narrowed imported attributes without changing point count.
  - `duplicate`: `ncy 5 -> 6` increased output from `48/36` to `56/42` (pts/prims).
  - `extrude`: `depthxlate` changed placement while topology remained stable in tested font setup.

- Live validation networks:
  - `/obj/academy_attribfrommap_live`
  - `/obj/academy_attribnoise_live`

  - Confirmed practical stability baseline with `solver.substeps=5` and ground-plane collision.
- Docs updated:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/vellumconstraints_grain.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` and `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`

- 2026-02-13: Added SOP study note for `vellumconstraints` after live hair-pin debugging session.
- Docs reviewed:
  - `help/nodes/sop/vellumconstraints.txt`
- Example coverage:
  - No local `help/examples/nodes/sop/vellumconstraints/` folder in corpus.
  - Used fallback companion coverage from `sop/vellumsolver` examples + custom live setups.
- Key observed outcomes:
  - Separate staged constraints (`hair` then `pin`) are clearer and easier to debug.
  - Empty/wrong-class groups can silently disable constraints and mimic solver instability.
  - Validating group non-emptiness before solve is a high-value check.
- Docs updated:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/vellumconstraints.md`
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/sphere.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop/group.md` (non-empty group gotcha)
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` and `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md`

- 2026-02-13: Studied `sop/vellumsolver` with full local example sweep and heavy-solver hygiene.
- Docs reviewed:
  - `help/nodes/sop/vellumsolver.txt`
  - `help/examples/nodes/sop/vellumsolver/*.txt` (18 examples)
- Example handling policy followed for compute-heavy content:
  - Loaded exactly one example at a time, inspected, then deleted it before loading the next.
- Examples loaded/inspected (all deleted after inspection):
  - `AnimatedConstraints`, `AnimatedPressure`, `ArmLayer`, `ArmTarget`, `CollisionDisable`, `CollisionIgnore`, `DynamicAttach`, `DynamicStitchGlue`, `GluedGrains`, `HairOrient`, `ResolutionTarget`, `SimpleWeld`, `StiffnessDropoff`, `TetrahedralFiber`, `VaryingFriction`, `VellumFluidPhasesStart`, `VellumFluidPhasesReference`, `VellumFluidSetupGeo`.
- Key observed outcomes:
  - Dynamic constraint creation/update pattern repeatedly appears inside `vellumsolver/dopnet/forces`.
  - Collision control examples confirm practical use of `collisionignore`, `collisiongroup`, and `disableexternal` attrs.
  - Layering (`layer` + `layershock`) and multi-res targeting are strong reusable workflows.
  - Fluid phase example confirms DOP-side Vellum Source pattern; direct solver output may be empty at start frame while display merge contains collider/scene geometry.
- Docs updated:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/vellumsolver.md`
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (25 studied SOP nodes; example sets reviewed 44)
  - Updated `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (overall studied/notes 25; SOP 10.6%)
  - Updated `memory/sop_context.md` (added Vellum Solver pattern section)

- 2026-02-13: Finished all previously in-progress SOP notes using fallback coverage for nodes with missing local example folders.
- Completed nodes promoted to studied:
  - `copytopoints`, `boolean`, `switch`, `switchif`, `voronoifracture`, `name`, `groupsfromname`, `error`
- Companion examples additionally reviewed for completion evidence:
  - `help/examples/nodes/sop/copy/StampRandom.*` (switch in production context)
  - `help/examples/nodes/sop/foreach/cheese.*` (looped boolean/cookie context)
  - `help/examples/nodes/sop/surfsect/SurfsectBasic.*` (boolean-style surfsect companion)
- Additional observations recorded:
  - `switch1` in StampRandom is expression-driven from copy stamping.
  - `foreach/cheese` demonstrates boolean logic as companion `cookie` within iterative workflow.
- Progress updates:
  - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` now marks 24/24 visited SOP notes as studied.
  - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` SOP progress updated to 10.2%.
  - `memory/sop_context.md` updated with missing-example fallback strategy and switch/boolean companion patterns.

- 2026-02-13: Studied/tested SOP nodes `voronoifracture`, `scatter`, `name`, `groupsfromname`, `error`.

  - `help/nodes/sop/scatter.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/name.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/groupsfromname.txt`

- Examples loaded and inspected:
  - `/obj/academy_SpikyDeformingTorus` and `/obj/academy_DoorWithPolkaDots` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/scatter/*`
  - companion voronoi workflow in `/obj/academy_PackedFragments/sphere`
- Additional live validation network:
  - `/obj/academy_name_groups_error` for `name`/`groupsfromname`/`error` behavior.
- Key observed outcomes:
  - Scatter: stable-point workflows validated via `primnum`/`primuvw` and texture-space mode.
  - Voronoi fracture companion test: increasing scatter seeds `20 -> 40` increased packed pieces `20 -> 40` downstream.
  - Name/GroupsFromName: confirmed `name` values (`part0`, `part1`) and regenerated prefixed groups (`nm_part0`, `nm_part1`).
  - Error: warning severity passes geometry while reporting warning; error severity blocks downstream cook.
- Companion-node updates made in same session:
  - Updated `memory/nodes/sop/assemble.md` (seed-count scaling finding)

  - `help/nodes/sop/attribpromote.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/connectivity.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/partition.txt`

  - `/obj/academy_PackedFragments` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/assemble/PackedFragments.*`
- Additional live validation network:
  - `/obj/academy_switchif` (no local official `sop/switchif` example folder)
- Key observed outcomes:
  - Switch-If: element-count test on second input cleanly routes fallback/default branch.
  - AttribPromote: confirmed point `foo` -> primitive `foo` promotion and primitive `Cd` -> point `Cd` demotion.
  - Connectivity: examples use primitive connectivity ids (`ball`/`piece`) as downstream control channels.
  - Partition: example demonstrates connectivity->partition group naming flow for DOP object splitting.
  - Assemble: fracture output packed into 20 packed pieces with name/path metadata for RBD pipeline.
- Companion-node findings captured:
  - Strong companion usage documented for `scatter`, `voronoifracture`, and DOP handoff patterns in assemble/partition examples.
- Docs updated:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/switchif.md`
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/attribpromote.md`

- 2026-02-13: Studied/tested SOP nodes `fuse`, `group`, `switch`, `polyreduce`, `measure`.
- Docs reviewed:
  - `help/nodes/sop/fuse.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/group.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/switch.txt`
  - `help/nodes/sop/polyreduce.txt`

  - `/obj/academy_MeasureArea` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/measure/MeasureArea.*`
  - `/obj/academy_MeasureLaplacian` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/measure/MeasureLaplacian.*`
- Additional live validation network:
  - `/obj/academy_switch` (no local official `sop/switch` example folder)
- Key observed outcomes:
  - Fuse: `merge_all` `40 pts` -> `fuse1` `29 pts` with consolidation on; returns to `40 pts` when off.
  - Group + PolyReduce: edge group (`entity=2`) drives crease-preserving reduction; `60% -> 30%` reduces sphere output `432 -> 216` prims.
  - PolyReduce batwing baseline: `30720 -> 3072` prims at `percentage=10`; direct edits blocked on locked example instance.
  - Measure: `measure1` writes `area` attr; switching to perimeter with `attribname=perim_test` writes the new prim attr as expected.
  - Switch: selector routes branches; out-of-range indices clamp to valid range in this build (`-1 -> 0`, `3 -> last input`).
- Docs updated:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/fuse.md`
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/group.md`
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/switch.md`

- Examples loaded and inspected:
  - `/obj/academy_TorusBlast` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/blast/TorusBlast.*`
  - `/obj/academy_MergeAttributes` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/merge/MergeAttributes.*`
  - `/obj/academy_Squidremesh` from `help/examples/nodes/sop/remesh/Squidremesh.*`
- Additional live validation network:
  - `/obj/academy_merge_live` to test merge attribute propagation behavior explicitly.
- Key observed outcomes:
  - Blast: base deletion reduced torus from `100/100` to `93/91` (pts/prims); `negate=1` isolates to `7/3`.
  - Merge: output carries unioned attributes; in custom repro, missing `Cd` defaults appeared as white `(1,1,1)` rather than zero.
  - Remesh: adaptive example output `36417 pts / 72724 prims`; uniform mode and larger `targetsize` reduce topology substantially.
- Docs updated:
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/blast.md`
  - Added `memory/nodes/sop/merge.md`

  - `/obj/academy_boolean`
  - `/obj/academy_AttributeShuffle`
  - `/obj/academy_ForEachExamples`

- Key observed outcomes:
  - `copytopoints`: unpacked output scales to `800 pts / 600 prims`; `pack=1` collapses to `100 pts / 100 prims`.
  - `foreach` (block-based AttributeShuffle): validated piece-loop pattern; sticky notes confirm merge-ordering caveat.
  - `boolean::2.0`: validated union/intersect/subtract behavior with bbox deltas.
  - Local docs corpus has no node-scoped `help/examples/nodes/sop/boolean/` or `.../copytopoints/` folders; marked those notes as in-progress/partial where appropriate.

- 2026-02-13: Added reusable example-study tool modules to reduce ad-hoc Python usage.
- New tools added under `tool_modules/` and registered in `tool_modules/registry.py`:
  - `install_hda_file`: install `.otl/.hda` files with optional reload behavior.
  - `list_example_nodes`: enumerate example docs/assets under `help/examples/nodes/<context>/`.
  - `instantiate_example_asset`: install an example asset file and create an instance.
  - `load_example`: resolve official example by `context/node/example_name`, install, and instantiate.
  - `get_node_presentation`: inspect node presentation state (display/render/template/bypass/comment).
- Updated `AGENTS.md` tool list + architecture guidance to reflect module-based tool registration.
- Restart checkpoint:
  - Reload/restart Houdini MCP plugin so newly added tool modules are available to command dispatch.

- 2026-02-13: Fixed live MCP regressions in shared geometry stats + default-write validation.
- Updated `tool_modules/hda_utils.py`:
  - `geometry_stats` now computes vertex count using `Geometry.vertexCount()` when available, with fallback to `vertices()` and intrinsic `vertexcount`.
  - This fixes live failures in both `probe_geometry` and `validate_hda_behavior` on Houdini builds where `Geometry.vertices()` is unavailable.
- Updated `tool_modules/set_hda_parm_default.py`:
  - Added post-write verification to confirm template defaults actually persist after `setParmTemplateGroup`.
  - Tool now raises a clear error when defaults cannot be changed (for example non-editable built-in parms on object-level HDAs) instead of returning false success.
- Live verification on connected Houdini:
  - `probe_geometry(/obj/academy_polyextrude/output1)` now succeeds (points/prims/vertices returned).
  - `validate_hda_behavior` on `/obj/mcp_verify1` with JSON-string args now succeeds (`Valid: True`, `Errors: 0`).
  - `set_hda_parm_default(node_path=/obj/mcp_verify1, param_name=t, default_value=\"1.25\")` now correctly fails with explicit non-persisted-default error.
  - `set_hda_parm_default` still succeeds on editable custom HDA parms (validated on `tskrivan::primitive_generator_sop::1.0` `sphere_radius`, then restored to `1.0`).
- Restart checkpoint:
  - If a stale plugin process is running, reload or restart the Houdini MCP plugin so modules importing `geometry_stats` pick up the latest helper implementation.

- 2026-02-12: Patched refactored tool regressions after validation pass.
- Updated `tool_modules/get_node_info.py` to handle template-flag queries safely on OBJ nodes (fallback to `isGenericFlagSet`).
- Updated `tool_modules/validate_hda_behavior.py` to:
  - accept JSON-string or list inputs for `cases`, `comparisons`, and `require_point_attributes`,
  - resolve geometry from SOP nodes or OBJ display/render SOPs before probing.
- Updated `tool_modules/set_hda_parm_default.py` to:
  - coerce string defaults (`"1.25"`, `"true"`, JSON arrays) into correct value types,
  - coerce per-parameter-type tuple values (float/int/string),
  - use `server._resolve_hda_definition` explicitly.
- Restart checkpoint: rerun failing repros:
  - `get_node_info` on `/obj/mcp_verify1` should no longer throw.
  - `set_hda_parm_default` with scalar string should succeed.
  - `validate_hda_behavior` on object-level HDA should resolve geometry and run.
- 2026-02-12 verification run completed:
  - `get_node_info(/obj/mcp_verify1)` succeeded (no template-flag exception).
  - Created object-level verification HDA: `mcp::verify_asset::1.0` at `otls/mcp_verify_asset.hda`.
  - `set_hda_parm_default(node_path=/obj/mcp_verify1, param_name=t, default_value=\"1.25\")` succeeded.
  - `validate_hda_behavior` on `/obj/mcp_verify1` with JSON-string `cases`/`comparisons`/`require_point_attributes` succeeded (`Valid: True`, `Errors: 0`).
- Next checkpoint: optionally run broader regression tests for tool-module bridge paths and add automated tests for these three regressions.
- 2026-02-12: Began Houdini AI Academy training on `sop/lattice`.
  - Reviewed `memory/index.md`, `memory/houdini_ai_academy.md`, and `memory/sop_context.md`.
  - Read official docs in `help/nodes/sop/lattice.txt` and reviewed example notes in `help/examples/nodes/sop/lattice/*.txt`.
  - Built practical test network at `/obj/academy_lattice` with `sphere -> bound -> xform -> lattice -> output`.
  - Verified deformation via bbox delta after cage transform.
  - Inspected example OTL internals by loading and unlocking:
    - `/obj/academy_DeformLattice`
    - `/obj/academy_BallBounce`
    - `/obj/academy_LatticePerChunk`
  - Explicitly extracted and reviewed sticky-note (post-it) text from all three assets and relevant subnets.
  - Extracted reusable patterns for single-lattice and per-piece foreach-lattice workflows.
  - Updated records:
    - `memory/nodes/sop/lattice.md` (now marked studied with OTL findings)
    - `memory/nodes/sop_progress.md` (nodes studied = 1)
    - `memory/houdiin_ai_acedemy_progress.md` (fully studied = 1)
    - `memory/sop_context.md` (context-level lattice pattern notes)
